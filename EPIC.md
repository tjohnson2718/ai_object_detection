# Retail Analytics System - Project Plan

## Overview
This project aims to develop a retail analytics system that processes video feeds to track customer movement and analyze behavior patterns. The system uses a two-stage detection approach: YOLOv8 for person detection and a fine-tuned ResNet-50 model for clothing attribute analysis.

## MVP Goals (Week 9)
By the end of week 9, the system will:
1. Process video feeds in real-time
2. Detect and track people using YOLOv8
3. Analyze clothing attributes using fine-tuned ResNet-50
4. Generate simple movement patterns
5. Provide a basic web interface for visualization
6. Store and retrieve data locally
7. Run on a single machine without external dependencies

## Project Phases
